<happy>one thousand subscribers.
<idle>wow. <smug>weve come so far from this.
<explain>I think to celebrate this milestone <idle>im gonna take a trip back all the way to where it all started.
<sad>Umm mabye not that far. <smug>Perfect.
<explain>8 Year old me <annoyed>yes you might actually figure out my age in this video <idle>played a lot of games. <sad>TOO many games and i <explain>especially liked
multiplayer games <annoyed>trust me this is important later.

<idle>So at this point i started coding with scratch.
<confused>I uh dont have any memories of it i mean <annoyed>i was 8 give me a break. <idle>All i know is that this sparked an interest in gamedev
that would never die.

<explain>After a few months of using scratch <smug>i was ready for the next level.
Game maker.
<idle>i had just gone on holidays so i decided to make my game about that. <explain>Spoiler alert. <annoyed>I never made it past
packing my bag.

<explain>Next up was the try random stuff era. <idle>I had joined something called coder dojo which is <confused>basically just a monthly club teaching kids how to code.
<explain>I learned a bit of java and this thing called
<confused>robocode where you like code AI for these tanks. <smug>Its pretty cool.

<idle>One day i overheard my dad teaching a class about object oriented programming. <explain>As an example he used none other than...
<smug>UNITY

<sad>Oh wait no were not there yet we're still in 2020.
<explain>This is my first unity game
<explain>boat balance. <idle>I gotta give myself credit. <smug>This game is suprisingly fun. Its entirely based on the
RigidBody dot AddForce fuction so <happy>lets try it out!

<explain>Next up just a day after Boat Balance we have
Arena and <idle>umm. <annoyed>This game is real bad. <confused>I dont know what happened but boat balance is just better than this.
<confused>I guess it was probably because <explain>i was experimenting a lot. <explain>Like this
minecraft wither is me learning
blender and <explain>these monsters are me finding the
asset store.

<idle>Now we have slime chopper which is intended for mobile,
<sad>hence the name slime chopper mobile. <confused>It's okay i guess.
<idle>You can see me learing unitys particle system here and a <explain>bit of UI design.
<annoyed>Its pretty bad UI design but <idle>its there.

<explain>This is black out and its an odd one. <idle>The goal is to kill all the monsters before you
<confused>faint from a head injury. <explain>You can see me trying out
nav mesh and a <idle>bit more
blender.

<idle>At this point i started spooderCode. <explain>My first videos were... <sad>Interesting.
<idle>I actually did tutorials here instead of this kind of video.
<happy>My most popular video is actually a tutorial.
<explain>How to export as an exe file unity.

<idle>Next up we have Blaster Boost.
<smug>I gotta admit i have a soft spot for this game.
<happy>Just looking back at this now i am getting some serious nostalgia. <idle>This was my first long term project lasting about a year, <annoyed>though most of that time was spent not working on the game.
<idle>This is the point of my gamedev career where i actually had to deal with the one problem that kills all indie devs.
<angry>MOTIVATION.
<explain>This game took a really long time and i learned <idle>SO many things from making it.
(Save Files.)
(Procedural generation.)
(Boss fights.)
Loads of stuff like that.

<explain>Around this time i started doing game jams. <idle>Every year me and my dad would do the gmtk game jam.
2020 (Berserker)
2021 (Sheep crossing)
2022 (Sixes)
2023 (Bumbling dad)
<explain>These game jams were great as we had to <idle>learn about scoping and doing things quickly.

<idle>I started off 2022 with Slime Run.
<explain>An endless runner that i would release on the app store and google play. <happy>This is the first game that i actually pulled together into a finished game.
<explain>I had adverts running in the game in the attempt to make some money but i made like
<annoyed>1 euro. <idle>The main problem with this game was putting it on mobile. <sad>I swear to god,
<angry>WHY DOES APPLE HAVE SO MANY REQUIREMENTS. <annoyed>Android just want their 25 euro and you can do all you want <confused>but apple?
<annoyed>nooooo.

<smug>Ahh Stupidiverse. <sad>This game started off with me being bored while waiting for my dad to <explain>start working on a project we were planning.
<confused>This game had an interesting development plan, <annoyed>that being it didnt even have one. <confused>I just added whatever sounded coolest to me.
<idle>This game was multiplayer because my <explain>cousin wanted to play something with me but they didnt have any multiplayer games on their pc.
<sad>The entire time i was working on this game my dad was annoying me to work on his game.

<explain>Next is Grapploteer. <idle>This game was
<angry>HELL to finish. <explain>It was a puzzle game with teleporting as the main mechanic. <annoyed>Little did i know that i picked to of the hardest things to make.
<angry>Puzzle games are ridiculously hard to make. <annoyed>I spent so long just drawing puzzles on pieces of paper.
<idle>I even have them stuck on my wall to remind me of the game.
<sad>Teleporting though was an entirely different problem. <annoyed>The amount of times the character either entered the floor or teleported a few blocks away from where i aimed was <angry>ridiculous.
<confused>I rewrote just the movement code 3 times. <idle>The scope of this game had to be cut down <sad>many times. <explain>It was originally supposed to have 40 puzzles.
<annoyed>It ended up having 28. <idle>This game was the first game i released on steam but <smug>after putting slime run on the app store it was nothing.
<idle>It was also the first time i had to do any <explain>REAL bugfixing. <annoyed>I had to have people playtest the game and me just <idle>sitting there writing down problems.
<smug>I remember having a trello board filled with bugs i needed to fix. <angry>It was a nightmare.

<smug>Now we are at present day.
<idle>Brawlberry. <happy>This is the first game that me and my dad are actually working together on.
<explain>Its a coop roguelike
<smug>told you it would be important.
<idle>We are planning on releasing it on steam so <happy>please go whislist it there. <explain>This game is going to hopefully be the highest quality game ive ever made and <smug>we have big plans for it.

<happy>So yeah! <happy>Thats it! <smug>That is my entire gamedev career! <idle>I hope you guys found it interesting and ill <smug>see you in the next one...
