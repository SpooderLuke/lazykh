This is a save button. Most games have them and nine tea nine percent have some sort of saving.
They must be easy right? Wrong. These things are painful to code. But today i'm going to shine a light on the insane programming behind save systems.

So, the main problem with save systems is knowing what to save. I think the best way to show this is with an example.
Alright so lets say we want to save this bouncing ball in its exact state. Well we'll need to save its position, its current velocity and its rotation. So the position we can use a vector. We'll probably need another vector for the velocity and one for the rotation too.

Now that was actually simple enough! We can write those three values to a text file and read it when we need to.
The problem arises when we try something a bit more complex, lets say a mine craft chunk. I dont actually know how they are saved but i do know they get big, like really big. Did you know that the world file for the mine craft server to be to tea is 5 there a bites large. Guess what. Thats wrong its actually 20 there a bites.

The problem is there is just so much to save in games like this and game developers have to get really creative to make things work.

So lets code a save system!
